\chapter{Introduction}

Neural networks have emerged
as the dominant force
in machine learning, 
and for good reason.
Deep learning methods
have displayed an incredible
ability to scale to large datasets
and solve large variety of
difficult problems.
The modularity of deep learning 
approaches has enabled the community
to advance on many fronts,
ranging from speech recognition
to robotics, while retaining
the same core methodology.

While neural networks 
are the de facto choice
for many machine learning problems,
they still have faults,
and many of those faults
are being addressed by the community.
Modeling uncertainty has been a staple
component of machine learning,
and the community
has recently explored
incorporating ideas
from statistics into deep learning,
a subfield called probabilistic deep learning.
