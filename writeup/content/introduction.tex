\chapter{Introduction}

Neural networks have emerged
as a dominant force
in machine learning,
and for good reason.
Deep learning methods
have displayed an incredible
ability to scale to large datasets
and solve a variety of
difficult problems.
The modularity of deep learning 
approaches has enabled the community
to advance on many fronts,
ranging from speech recognition
to robotics, while retaining
the same core methodology.

While neural networks
are the de facto choice
for many machine learning problems,
they still have faults
that are being addressed,
by the community.
Probabilistic modeling has been a staple
component of machine learning,
and the community
is currently exploring
incorporating ideas
various statistics into deep learning.
